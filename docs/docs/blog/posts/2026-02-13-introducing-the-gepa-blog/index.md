# Introducing the GEPA Blog

Welcome to the GEPA blog. This is where we will share research updates, new applications, usecases and real-world results from the GEPA ecosystem.

We also invite community members to present GEPA-related case studies and applications. If you have built something with GEPA and would like to share your experience, reach out via [email](mailto:lakshyaaagrawal@berkeley.edu), [GitHub](https://github.com/gepa-ai/gepa/issues), [Discord](https://discord.gg/WXFSeVGdbW), or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gepa-ai/shared_invite/zt-3o352xhyf-QZDfwmMpiQjsvoSYo7M1_w).

Stay tuned for upcoming posts (something exciting is cooking!)
